The user will go to site and login. He/she gets a 1 week free trial, then can pay $10 per month to use the features. Once logged in, user must enter the username and password for his/her youtube, rumble, odysee and bitchute channels. That info is stored in our data base so user can enter that info one time and its saved. When the user wants to upload a video to YT, RUMB, ODYSEE AND BITCHUTE user logs into our site, clicks on the upload tab/button and sees TITLE FIELD, DESCRIPTION FIELD, UPOAD VIDEO BUTTON, AND UPLOAD THUMBNAIL BUTTON. After user enters that information he can chose to CHECK OFF 1 or all 4 of the sites. So for example the user checks off all 4. and presses start. The site/bot will one by one upload that video and details to each one of the sites listed above. (user can view the uploading process) (if the site has human captcha stop points, then THE USER can enter that info manually and press continue)
